# Survival Analysis

1. Applied various popular estimators including Kaplan-Meier Estimator, Nelson-Aalen Estimator with visualization of the cumulative hazard.<br>
2. Performed non-parametric tests including M-H test and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test to compare k survival functions.<br>
3. Applied Cox Proportional Hazard model to estimate the hazard. <br>
4. Compared AFT(Accelerated Failure Time) model with Cox model on interpretability<br>
