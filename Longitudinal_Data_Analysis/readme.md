## Skin-Cancer Study 

1. Fit a Generalized Linear mixed model with model selection via AIC.
2. Fit a Generalized Estimating Equation and perform model diagnostics. 
3. Identify outliers via Mahalanobis distance and fitted trajectory. Refit the model after removing the outliers, investigate
the features related to skin-cancer-free survival
