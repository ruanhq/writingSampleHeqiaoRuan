## Linear Mixed-Effects Model

1. MCEM(Monte-carlo EM) algorithm for inference of the variance component for random error and random effects as well as the performance investigation. </br>
2. Model Selection of linear mixed model via a modified BIC criterion incorporating effective sample size for fixed effects and random effects separately. Simulation study on the model selection consistency.</br>
3. Improved Sumca(Simple, Unified Monte-carlo Assisted) estimation of MSPE of the variance components in mixed model. </br>
